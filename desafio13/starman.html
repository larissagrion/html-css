        <p> Hey now, now <br>
            Oh, oh, oh
        </p>

        <p> Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low <br>
        I leaned back on my radio <br>
        Some cat was laying down some rock 'n' roll <br>
        "Lotta soul," he said <br>
        Then the loud sound did seem to fade <br>
        Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase <br>
        That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive <br>

                There's a starman waiting in the sky <br>
                He'd like to come and meet us <br>
                But he thinks he'd blow our minds <br>
                There's a starman waiting in the sky <br>
                He's told us not to blow it <br>
                'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile <br>

                Let the children lose it <br>
                Let the children use it <br>
                Let all the children boogie <br>

                I had to phone someone so I picked on you <br>
                Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too <br>
                Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two <br>
                Look out your window, I can see his light <br>
                If we can sparkle he may land tonight <br>
                Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
